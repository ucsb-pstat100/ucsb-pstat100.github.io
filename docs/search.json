Labs will be assigned weekly, and are designed to be mostly completed during Section on Monday but won’t be due until 11:59pm on Wednesdays.\nHomeworks: slightly larger in scope than labs; will contain both programming and theoretical/conceptual concepts. We will have a total of 3 homework assignments released throughout the quarter; typically you will have 1-2 weeks to work on the homeworks and you are encouraged to start as early as possible!\nMini Projects: more open-ended than homeworks and labs, and are designed to more closely simulate real-world data science projects and endeavors. We will have a total of 3 mini projects (released in non-exam weeks where there are no homeworks due) throughout the quarter, and you are encouraged to work collaboratively.\nFinal Project: a final, comprehensive project that will be due during finals week. You will be required to work in teams on the Final Project.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinal Project\n\n\n\nThe final project will be due by 11:59pm on Tuesday, June 11.\n\n\n\n2 In-Class Assessments (ICAs) will be administered (see below for dates). I hesitate to call these “exams” because they are not intended to be as high-stakes as exams, however they are designed to test your retention of course material. More information will be released as we approach the date of the first ICA.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssessment Dates\n\n\n\n\nIn-Class Assessment 1: Thursday, April 25, 2024 in BUCHN 1940 (our Lecture classroom) starting at 9:30 (our regular class time)\nIn-Class Assessment 2: Thursday, May 23, 2024 in BUCHN 1940 (our Lecture classroom) starting at 9:30 (our regular class time)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nThere will be no ICAs offered at alternate times, for any reasons. So, please plan accordingly!\n\n\n\nFinal Course Grades\nYour final course grade will be computed according to the following weights:\n\n\n\nAssessment\nWeight\n\n\n\n\nLabs\n10%\n\n\nHW\n15%\n\n\nMini Projects\n20%\n\n\nFinal Project\n25%\n\n\nIn-Class Assessments\n30%\n\n\n\nYour final letter grade will be issued according to the following scheme (cutoffs between plusses and minuses will be calculated at the end of the quarter):\n\nA- – A+: 90 – 100%\nB– – B+: 80 – 89.99%\nC– – C+: 70 – 79.99%\nD– – D+ : 60 – 69.99%\nF: 0 – 59.99%\n\nI have elected to adopt an uncurved grading scheme to eliminate any sense of “competition” among students; I highly encourage you all to collaborate with and uplift each other.

No work will be accepted beyond 48 hours after the original deadline. Additionally, because projects may/will be collaborative, late project submissions will not be accepted.\n\n\nCommunication\nThere are two primary means of communication outside of scheduled class meetings: office hours and a Discord Server. If you are unsure of how to reach out to appropriate parties, please consult the following table:\n\n\n\nTopic\nRedirect to…\n\n\n\n\nTroubleshooting codes\nDiscord\n\n\nChecking answers\nOffice hours or Discord\n\n\nClarifying assignment content\nOffice hours or Discord\n\n\nAssignment submission\nGradescope\n\n\nRe-evaluation request\nGradescope\n\n\nQuestion about missing grades\nFill Out This Form\n\n\n\nSome additional comments:\n\nPlease note that we (the course staff) request you refrain from emailing us except in case of extreme emergency (it is up to you to decide what is an ‘emergency’). Please bring all of your questions to the course staff during either Office Hours or after Lecture/Section. (Also, please note that DMs [Direct Messages] sent to the course staff through Discord will be ignored. Additionally, non-emergency emails [e.g. about content, missing grades, etc.] will be ignored.) Thank you!\nIf you have questions or concerns about missing grades, please use the form linked in the table above. You are allowed to submit the form multiple times, but we ask that you please wait at least 48 business hours before submitting follow-ups. Thank you!\n\n\n\nCollaboration and Academic Integrity\nData Science (as we will see) is an inherently collaborative field. As such, you are not only allowed but also encouraged to collaborate on assignments (be they lab, homework, or project). However, there are limitations to collaboration:\n\ncollaboration on the ICAs is strictly prohibited\ndo not copy other people’s work and try to pass it off as your own\nif/when you work in groups, include the names of all group members on the assignment\n\nAnyone found guilty of academic misconduct will be reported to the Academic Senate, and will receive at minimum a failing grade on the assignment in question; further actions may also include failing the course, and marks being made on permanent records. Depending on the severity of the infraction, expulsion is also a possibility.\nBasically, don’t cheat- please! If you’re ever struggling with course material, please come talk to me or the TA’s. We are truly here for you, and want only the best for you.\n\n\nSection Switching\nLab Sections take place in special “Collaborate Classrooms” which are equipped with laptops. There are only a fixed number of seats and laptops in these classrooms, meaning we cannot under any circumstance over-enroll sections. Therefore, if you want to switch section unofficially (we do not have the ability to switch your official enrollment through GOLD), please follow the steps at this link. Any requests to switch sections that do not adhere to the guidelines posted at that link will be ignored."

Developed in the 1990s at Bell Labs, it was built upon the S language, with the crucial benefit of being freely available to the public.\nR understand many of the basic mathematical operations we use on paper:\n\n\n\nOperation\nR Symbol\nExample\n\n\n\n\nAddition\n+\n2 + 3\n\n\nSubtraction\n-\n2 - 3\n\n\nMultiplication\n*\n2 * 3\n\n\nExponentiation\n^\n2 ^ 3\n\n\nDivision\n/\n2 / 3\n\n\n\nFor example:\n\n((2 + 3) / 4) ^ 5\n\n[1] 3.051758\n\n\nNote: like most programming languages, R obeys the order of operations:\n\nParentheses\nExponentiation\nMultiplication\nDivision\nAddition\nSubtraction\n\nThe variable assignment operator in R (i.e. the symbol we use to assign a value to a variable) is &lt;-:\n\nx &lt;- 2\nx\n\n[1] 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nTechnically, using = will also work for variable assignment:\n\ny = 2\ny\n\n[1] 2\n\n\nHowever, when programming in R, it is customary to use the &lt;- operator instead.\n\n\nThere are a couple of restrictions on what we can name variables in R:\n\nVariable names cannot start with a number (but they can contain numbers). So 2var is not a valid variable name, whereas var2 is.\nVariable names cannot start with a period (but they can contain periods). So .my_var is not a valid variable name but my.var is.\nVariable names cannot include special characters (e.g. +, *, etc.) anywhere. For instance, *myvar is not a valid variable name.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote for Python Users\n\n\n\nIf you are a Python user, you might not be used to using periods in variable names (since, in Python, periods typically deliniate the start of a method). In R, periods do not have any correspondence with methods or functions, so feel free to use them in your variable names!"

    "section": "Data Types and Data Structures",
    "text": "Data Types and Data Structures\nWe can think of data types as the fundamental classes to which objects belong. There are 4 main data types in R:\n\ndouble (aka numeric; refers to real numbers)\ninteger\ncharacter (aka string)\nlogical (aka boolean)\n\nWe can extract the particular data type of an object using the typeof() function:\n\ntypeof(1)\n\n[1] \"double\"\n\ntypeof(1L)\n\n[1] \"integer\"\n\ntypeof(\"hello world\")\n\n[1] \"character\"\n\ntypeof(TRUE)\n\n[1] \"logical\"\n\n\nA note on booleans: in R, there are only two logical objects: TRUE (which is equivalent to T) and FALSE (which is equivalent to F). Pay close attention to the capitalization: True is NOT a valid logical type object in R (even though it is in Python)!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThere are actually two more data types in R: \"complex\" and \"raw\". You may want to familiarize yourself with the \"complex\" type (which deals with complex numbers), but I almost guarantee you will never encounter the \"raw\" type in the wild.\n\n\nIndividual R objects can be collectively arranged into larger, more complex data structures. There are 6 main data structures in R:\n\nscalars: scalar values (i.e. single values)\nvectors: sequence of values, that must all be of the same type\nmatrices: rows and columns of values\narrays: rows, columns, and layers of values (you can think of these as essentially matrices stacked on top of each other, or, more mathematically, as akin to tensors), all of the same type\nlists: rows, columns, and layers of values, potentially of different types\nfactors: sequences of categorical values\ndataframes: rows and columns of values, potentially of different types\n\nAs you can see, there are some pairs of data structures that appear similar, but differ in the key aspect of whether or not they allow different data types. We will revisit this notion in a bit.\n\nVectors and Matrices\nFirst, let’s talk about how to create vectors in R. (In many ways, vectors form the fundamental unit in R.) The easiest way is to use the combine function, c():\n\nc(1, 2, \"hello\", \"world\")\n\n[1] \"1\"     \"2\"     \"hello\" \"world\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nDon’t forget the c when creating vectors! Simply listing the elements of a vector within a set of parentheses in R will result in an error:\n\n(1, 2, \"hello\", \"world\")\n\nError: &lt;text&gt;:1:3: unexpected ','\n1: (1,\n      ^\n\n\n\n\nTo create a matrix, we use the matrix() function:\n\nmatrix(c(1, 2, 3, 4), \n       nrow = 2,\n       byrow = T)\n\n     [,1] [,2]\n[1,]    1    2\n[2,]    3    4\n\n\nNote the specification of byrow = T: this simply tells R to populate the elements of the matrix by rows. In contrast, we could have specified byrow = F:\n\nmatrix(c(1, 2, 3, 4), \n       nrow = 2,\n       byrow = F)\n\n     [,1] [,2]\n[1,]    1    3\n[2,]    2    4\n\n\nNow, let’s demonstrate what is meant by the fact that all objects in a matrix must be of the same type. Specifically, let’s try and create a matrix from the elements 1, 2, \"hello\", \"world\":\n\nmatrix(c(1, 2, \"hello\", \"world\"),\n       nrow = 2,\n       byrow = F)\n\n     [,1] [,2]   \n[1,] \"1\"  \"hello\"\n[2,] \"2\"  \"world\"\n\n\nNotice that R has automatically coerced all of the elements to be characters (even though the numbers 1 and 2 were originally specified using the double type)!\n\n\nDataframes\nIndeed, this is one of the motivating factors for using dataframes, instead of matrices. To create a dataframe from scratch, we use the data.frame() function, and specify the columns of the data frame:\n\ndata.frame(\n  c(1, 2),\n  c(\"hello\", \"world\")\n)\n\n  c.1..2. c..hello....world..\n1       1               hello\n2       2               world\n\n\nA couple of things to note:\n\nWe’ve managed to preserve the original data types of our objects.\nBy default, dataframes have column names (and the default names that R creates are pretty sucky…)\n\nLet’s explicitly specify our column names:\n\ndata.frame(\n  col1 = c(1, 2),\n  col2 = c(\"hello\", \"world\")\n)\n\n  col1  col2\n1    1 hello\n2    2 world\n\n\nIf we really wanted to, we could even specify row names:\n\ndata.frame(\n  col1 = c(1, 2),\n  col2 = c(\"hello\", \"world\"),\n  row.names = c(\"row1\", \"row2\")\n)\n\n     col1  col2\nrow1    1 hello\nrow2    2 world\n\n\nWe’ve posted a separate lab covering even more operations on dataframes, which can be accessed here.\n\n\nFactors\nAs mentioned above, factors are ideal when encoding categorical data. Recall (from Lecture 01) that categorical variables can be further subdivided into nominal and ordinal variables; analagously, R has factors and ordered factors.\nAs a simple example:\n\nfav_cols &lt;- factor(\n  c(\"red\", \"green\", \"blue\", \"green\", \"yellow\")\n)\nfav_cols\n\n[1] red    green  blue   green  yellow\nLevels: blue green red yellow\n\n\nTo extract the levels of a factor (i.e. the categories), we use the levels() function:\n\nlevels(fav_cols)\n\n[1] \"blue\"   \"green\"  \"red\"    \"yellow\"\n\n\nIf we wanted to create an ordered factor, we can still use the factor() function but now pass in an additional argument that states ordered = T:\n\nmy_grades &lt;- factor(\n  c(\"A+\", \"A-\", \"A\", \"A-\"),\n  ordered = T,\n  levels = c(\"A+\", \"A\", \"A-\")\n)\n\nmy_grades\n\n[1] A+ A- A  A-\nLevels: A+ &lt; A &lt; A-"

Conditional statements in R are structured as follows:\n\nif(cond1) {\n  &lt;executes if cond1 is true&gt;\n} else if(cond2) {\n  &lt;executes if cond2 is true&gt;\n} ... else {\n  &lt;executes if none of the previous conditions are true&gt;\n}\n\nFor example:\n\nx &lt;- 15\n\nif(x &lt;= 10) {\n  print(\"x is small\")\n} else if (x &lt;= 20) {\n  print(\"x is moderate\")\n} else {\n  return(\"x is massive!\")\n}\n\n[1] \"x is moderate\"\n\n\nOne thing to note is that each of the conditions must be a scalar of length 1:\n\nx &lt;- c(15, 15)\n\nif(x &lt;= 10) {\n  print(\"x is small\")\n} else if (x &lt;= 20) {\n  print(\"x is moderate\")\n} else {\n  return(\"x is massive!\")\n}\n\nError in if (x &lt;= 10) {: the condition has length &gt; 1\n\n\nIf we want to control based on vector conditions, and we have only two cases to consider, we can use the ifelse() function. For example:\n\nx &lt;- c(2, 3, 4, 5, 6) \n\nifelse(x %% 2 == 0, \"even\", \"odd\")\n\n[1] \"even\" \"odd\"  \"even\" \"odd\"  \"even\""

    "text": "Packages\nIn R, we use the term packages to refer to collections of functions and objects stored under a common name. (This is the equivalent of what is often referred to as a module, in Python).\nTo install a package in R, we use the syntax\n\ninstall.packages(\"&lt;package_name&gt;\")\n\nIf you try to install a package you have already installed, R will give you a warning message prompting you to either update the package or cancel your command.\nTo load a package into a document or working environment, use the library() function:\n\nlibrary(&lt;package_name&gt;) # note the LACK of quotation marks!\n\nAs an example, you’ll notice a code chunk at the start of this lab with the command library(ottr)- this command loads the ottr package into our environment (which in turn gives us access to various autograder-related functionality).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nFor more information about R packages, consult this resource."

    "text": "The Vectorization of R\nIt is often stated that R is vectorized. Effectively, this means that the fundamental object in R is a vector, and most functions, when applied to vectors, are applied element-wise.\nFor instance:\n\nc(1, 2, 3) + c(1, 1, 1)\n\n[1] 2 3 4\n\n\nis equivalent to\n\nc(1, 2, 3) + 1\n\n[1] 2 3 4\n\n\nMost functions are also vectorized; i.e. allow for vector-valued inputs. If you want to make a user-defined function vectorized, you can wrap your function in a call to the Vectorize() function. For example, consider the following implementation of the sign function:\n\nsgn_non_vectorized &lt;- function(x) {\n  if(x &lt; 0) {\n    return(\"negative\")\n  } else if(x == 0) {\n    return(\"zero\")\n  } else {\n    return(\"positive\")\n  }\n}\n\nCalling sgn_non_vectorized(-1) is fine:\n\nsgn_non_vectorized(-1)\n\n[1] \"negative\"\n\n\nhowever calling sgn_non_vectorized(c(-1, 1)) causes problems:\n\nsgn_non_vectorized(c(-1, 1))\n\nError in if (x &lt; 0) {: the condition has length &gt; 1\n\n\nWe can fix this using the Vectorize() function:\n\nsgn_vectorized &lt;- Vectorize(\n  function(x){sgn_non_vectorized(x)}\n)\nsgn_vectorized(c(-1, 1))\n\n[1] \"negative\" \"positive\"\n\n\nBy the way, note that the above example also demonstrates the following: unlike in Python, you do not need to explicitly include a return statement in the body of an R function. By default, R will return whatever the final non-assignment step of your code is."

    "text": "Recursion\nSince most of you have likely taken at least one programming course before, you are probably familiar with the notion of recursion. Loosely speaking, in computer science, we us the term recursion to describe a situation in which the current computational step depends on one or more computational steps that were completed in the past.\nA simple mathematical example of recursion is the Fibonacci Numbers, which is a sequence \\(\\{a_n\\}\\) of numbers defined through the recursive relationship \\[ a_0 = 0, \\quad a_1 = 1, \\quad a_{n} = a_{n - 1} + a_{n - 2} \\ (\\forall n \\geq 2) \\] For instance, the first 7 Fibonacci numbers are \\(\\{0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8\\}\\).\nLet’s say we want to create a function fib() that takes in a single integer input n and outputs the nth Fibonacci number. Firstly, this is not as simple as the examples we’ve seen before because there isn’t a closed-form formula for the nth Fibonacci number1.\n\nHowever, we can think of defining this function recursively. The key is to note that, if we have configured our fib() function correctly, we have that\n\nfib(n) = fib(n) + fib(n - 1)\n\nWe also know that\n\nfib(0) = 0\nfib(1) = 1\n\nThis motivates us to define our fib() function as follows:\n\nfib &lt;- Vectorize(function(n) {\n  if(n == 0) {\n    return(0)\n  } else if (n == 1) {\n    return(1)\n  } else {\n    return( fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2))\n  }\n})\n\nAs an example:\n\nfib(1:7)\n\n[1]  1  1  2  3  5  8 13\n\n\nwhich matches what we computed “by hand”, above."
