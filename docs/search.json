My research focuses on creating and applying Gaussian process machine learning models to spatiotemporal data. I use these methods to make long-term forecasts of climate variables and crop yields, as well as to model magma movement and volcanic eruptions. As a TA, I’ve primarily supported Data Science courses at UCSB, especially the Data Science Capstone, which I’ve been involved with for the past four years. Outside of research and teaching, I enjoy spending time with my friends, family, and cats, working on side NLP projects, and working out at the gym.

Otherwise, the variable is categorical."

    "text": "Tidy or Not?\nA Brief Interlude\n\nFirstly, I’ll stress this again: I view the main point of the tidy framework as a way to link the semantics and the structure of a dataset.\nFrom that point of view, there is nothing inherently “incorrect” about modifying our variables and observations as we did on the previous slide to make the wide layout tidy.\nHowever, I believe it “puts the cart before the horse” - in the field, we typically start with the semantics, and then structure the data around the semantics. Changing the semantics to match the structure (though not incorrect) is a little backwards."

    "text": "Tidy or Not?\nA Brief Interlude\n\nThere’s another reason adopting these second set of variables is not the best idea, and it has to do with the notion of updating a data frame.\nSuppose we gain additional data, from Summer 2025.\n\nIn the second set of semantics, we’d have to add an entirely new variable to incorporate this new information.\nIn the first set of semantics (where we simply have a Quarter variable and an Enrollment variable), we can update out dataset by simply adding a new observation (which is much more efficient.)\n\n\n\n\n“[…] it is surprisingly difficult to precisely define variables and observations in general.” – Wickham, 2004; page 4"

    "text": "Tidy Data\nPros and Cons\n\nSo, yes, there is some subjectivity regarding what we classify as variables.\n\nBut, to reiterate a point from yesterday: a data dictionary often takes the guesswork out of things.\n\nFinally, I’d like to make another note: messy (the opposite of tidy) datasets sometimes have their benefits!\nFor example, messy datasets can actually appear (visually) more succinct than their tidy counterparts, which is why you’ll sometimes see messy datasets presented in reports or presentations.\nBut, tidy data is usually preferred in the analysis stage of the DSL, as computers are a bit better-equipped at handling tidy data than they are at handling messy data."

To that effect, I am allowing:\n\nOne late homework, which must be submitted within 24 hours of the original deadline\nTwo late labs, which must be submitted within 24 hours of the original deadline\n\nGiven that the projects will be submitted in groups, no late submissions for the projects will be accepted for any reason. Additionally, as stated above, we will not be offering any make-ups for the ICAs; furthermore, failure to take both ICAs will result in a grade of “F” being administered.\n\n\nCommunication\nThere are two primary means of communication outside of scheduled class meetings: office hours and an EdStem Discussion Forum (please see Canvas for a join link; for security purposes, we are only allowing currently-enrolled students join the discussion forum). If you are unsure of how to reach out to appropriate parties, please consult the following table:\n\n\n\nTopic\nRedirect to…\n\n\n\n\nTroubleshooting codes\nEdStem\n\n\nChecking answers\nOffice hours or EdStem\n\n\nClarifying assignment content\nOffice hours or EdStem\n\n\nAssignment submission\nGradescope\n\n\nRe-evaluation request\nGradescope\n\n\nQuestion about missing grades\nFill Out This Form\n\n\n\nSome additional comments:\n\nPlease note that we (the course staff) request you refrain from emailing us except in case of extreme emergency (it is up to you to decide what is an ‘emergency’). Please bring all of your questions to the course staff during either Office Hours or after Lecture/Section. Thank you!\nIf you have questions or concerns about missing grades, please use the form linked in the table above. You are allowed to submit the form multiple times, but we ask that you please wait at least 48 business hours before submitting follow-ups. Thank you!\n\n\n\nCollaboration and Academic Integrity\nData Science (as we will see) is an inherently collaborative field. Indeed, collaboration is required for both projects; collaboration is also encouraged for homework and lab assignments. However, there are limitations to collaboration:\n\ncollaboration on the ICAs is strictly prohibited\ndo not copy other people’s work and try to pass it off as your own\nif/when you work in groups, include the names of all group members on the assignment\n\nFailure to abide by these principles will be treated as academic misconduct. Anyone found guilty of academic misconduct will be reported to the Academic Senate, and will receive at minimum a failing grade on the assignment in question; further actions may also include failing the course, and marks being made on permanent records. Depending on the severity of the infraction, expulsion is also a possibility.\nBasically, don’t cheat- please! If you’re ever struggling with course material, please come talk to me or the TA’s. We are truly here for you, and want only the best for you.\n\n\nSection Switching\nLab Sections take place in special “Collaborate Classrooms” which are equipped with laptops. There are only a fixed number of seats and laptops in these classrooms, meaning we cannot under any circumstance over-enroll sections. Therefore, if you want to switch section unofficially (we do not have the ability to switch your official enrollment through GOLD), please follow the steps at this link. Any requests to switch sections that do not adhere to the guidelines posted at that link will be ignored.\n\n\nAI Policy\nIt is undeniable that the recent advances in Generative AI (GenAI) and Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT have reshaped the educational landscape. Indeed, when utilized properly, they can be an incredibly useful power. With that said, I would like to establish some clear ground rules with regards to the use of GenAI in this class:\n\nThe use of AI on ICAs is strictly prohibited.\nThe use of AI on other assignments is discouraged, but not prohibited - I only ask that if you use AI (for a HW, Lab, or Project) that you please cite it.\n\nIf it is found that you used AI without citing its use, this will be treated as academic misconduct.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nPlease be careful when using Generative AI. It is still a relatively new innovation, and can not only occasionally produce inaccurate answers but can also produce unethical answers. Read all terms and conditions carefully, and ensure you understand (a) how the tool will give you an answer, and (b) what the tool will do with your data."

There is much we can learn from one another, and it can be an incredibly enlightening experience to discuss problems and ideas with one another. (Just make sure you don’t violate any of the Academic Integrity points listed above)\n\n\nStart things early!\nMake sure you’re giving yourself enough time to complete the homework assignments, labs, projects, and make sure to leave plenty of time to study for the ICAs. I’d recommend creating a weekly schedule for yourself, and allocating time each day for PSTAT 100 material (whether that be working on an assignment, reading lecture slides, or coming to Office Hours.\n\n\nPractice Makes Progress\nThe best way to start learning Data Science is to start doing Data Science. The various textbooks and resources linked on the Course Website come equipped with additional practice problems and exercises which I highly recommend you work through.\n\n\nAttend Office Hours (TA and Instructor) regularly\nEven if you don’t have a specific question, you’re always more than welcome to sit in on Office Hours and listen to other people’s questions. (Sometimes, doing so will help you formulate your own questions!)\n\n\nAttend Lectures and Discussion Sections.\nIt’s true that we do not have an attendance policy, but please don’t let yourselves fall behind on attendance. Studies show that regular exposure is the best way to learn material, and there really is no substitute for going to Section and Lecture. Also, while you’re in Lecture, take your own notes! Even the act of writing things down and having to synthesize what you think is important information can help you process and learn the material in real time.\n\n\nDon’t Be Too Hard on Yourself!\nThough a little stress can be a good motivating factor for some, please don’t stress yourself out too much. Your performance in this course is not an evaluation of who you are as a person!"

So 2var is not a valid variable name, whereas var2 is.\nVariable names cannot start with a period (but they can contain periods). So .my_var is not a valid variable name but my.var is.\nVariable names cannot include special characters (e.g. +, *, etc.) anywhere. For instance, *myvar is not a valid variable name.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote for Python Users\n\n\n\nIf you are a Python user, you might not be used to using periods in variable names (since, in Python, periods typically deliniate the start of a method). In R, periods do not have any correspondence with methods or functions, so feel free to use them in your variable names!"

Pay close attention to the capitalization: True is NOT a valid logical type object in R (even though it is in Python)!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThere are actually two more data types in R: \"complex\" and \"raw\". You may want to familiarize yourself with the \"complex\" type (which deals with complex numbers), but it is highly unlikely you will ever encounter the \"raw\" type in the wild.\n\n\nIndividual R objects can be collectively arranged into larger, more complex data structures. There are 6 main data structures in R:\n\nscalars: scalar values (i.e. single values)\nvectors: sequence of values, that must all be of the same type\nmatrices: rows and columns of values\narrays: rows, columns, and layers of values (you can think of these as essentially matrices stacked on top of each other, or, more mathematically, as akin to tensors), all of the same type\nlists: rows, columns, and layers of values, potentially of different types\nfactors: sequences of categorical values\ndataframes: rows and columns of values, potentially of different types\n\nAs you can see, there are some pairs of data structures that appear similar, but differ in the key aspect of whether or not they allow different data types. We will revisit this notion in a bit.\n\nVectors and Matrices\nFirst, let’s talk about how to create vectors in R. (In many ways, vectors form the fundamental unit in R.) The easiest way is to use the combine function, c():\n\nc(1, 2, \"hello\", \"world\")\n\n[1] \"1\"     \"2\"     \"hello\" \"world\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nDon’t forget the c when creating vectors! Simply listing the elements of a vector within a set of parentheses in R will result in an error:\n\n(1, 2, \"hello\", \"world\")\n\nError in parse(text = input): &lt;text&gt;:1:3: unexpected ','\n1: (1,\n      ^\n\n\n\n\nTo create a matrix, we use the matrix() function:\n\nmatrix(c(1, 2, 3, 4), \n       nrow = 2,\n       byrow = T)\n\n     [,1] [,2]\n[1,]    1    2\n[2,]    3    4\n\n\nNote the specification of byrow = T: this simply tells R to populate the elements of the matrix by rows. In contrast, we could have specified byrow = F:\n\nmatrix(c(1, 2, 3, 4), \n       nrow = 2,\n       byrow = F)\n\n     [,1] [,2]\n[1,]    1    3\n[2,]    2    4\n\n\nNow, let’s demonstrate what is meant by the fact that all objects in a matrix must be of the same type. Specifically, let’s try and create a matrix from the elements 1, 2, \"hello\", \"world\":\n\nmatrix(c(1, 2, \"hello\", \"world\"),\n       nrow = 2,\n       byrow = F)\n\n     [,1] [,2]   \n[1,] \"1\"  \"hello\"\n[2,] \"2\"  \"world\"\n\n\nNotice that R has automatically coerced all of the elements to be characters (even though the numbers 1 and 2 were originally specified using the double type)!\n\n\nDataframes\nIndeed, this is one of the motivating factors for using dataframes, instead of matrices. To create a dataframe from scratch, we use the data.frame() function, and specify the columns of the data frame:\n\ndata.frame(\n  c(1, 2),\n  c(\"hello\", \"world\")\n)\n\n  c.1..2. c..hello....world..\n1       1               hello\n2       2               world\n\n\nA couple of things to note:\n\nWe’ve managed to preserve the original data types of our objects.\nBy default, dataframes have column names (and the default names that R creates are pretty sucky…)\n\nLet’s explicitly specify our column names:\n\ndata.frame(\n  col1 = c(1, 2),\n  col2 = c(\"hello\", \"world\")\n)\n\n  col1  col2\n1    1 hello\n2    2 world\n\n\nIf we really wanted to, we could even specify row names:\n\ndata.frame(\n  col1 = c(1, 2),\n  col2 = c(\"hello\", \"world\"),\n  row.names = c(\"row1\", \"row2\")\n)\n\n     col1  col2\nrow1    1 hello\nrow2    2 world\n\n\nWe’ve posted a separate lab covering even more operations on dataframes, which can be accessed here.\n\n\nFactors\nAs mentioned above, factors are ideal when encoding categorical data. Recall (from Lecture 01) that categorical variables can be further subdivided into nominal and ordinal variables; analagously, R has factors and ordered factors.\nAs a simple example:\n\nfav_cols &lt;- factor(\n  c(\"red\", \"green\", \"blue\", \"green\", \"yellow\")\n)\nfav_cols\n\n[1] red    green  blue   green  yellow\nLevels: blue green red yellow\n\n\nTo extract the levels of a factor (i.e. the categories), we use the levels() function:\n\nlevels(fav_cols)\n\n[1] \"blue\"   \"green\"  \"red\"    \"yellow\"\n\n\nIf we wanted to create an ordered factor, we can still use the factor() function but now pass in an additional argument that states ordered = T:\n\nmy_grades &lt;- factor(\n  c(\"A+\", \"A-\", \"A\", \"A-\"),\n  ordered = T,\n  levels = c(\"A+\", \"A\", \"A-\")\n)\n\nmy_grades\n\n[1] A+ A- A  A-\nLevels: A+ &lt; A &lt; A-"

For example:\n\nx &lt;- c(1, 2, 3)\ny &lt;- c(2, 1, 4)\n\nThe way we interpret this output is:\n\nThe first element of x was less than or equal to the first element of y\nThe second element of x was not less than or equal to the second element of y\nThe third element of x was less than or equal to the third element of y\n\nWe most often use the result of comparisons in conditional statements (aka control flow).

Since I hope you have already been exposed to loops I’ll bypass a detailed discussion of how they work, opting instead to simply highlight the R syntax of loops.\n\nfor-loops\nA for loops is ideal when you want to repeat a task a fixed number of times. For example:\n\nfor(k in 2:4) {\n  print(k)\n}\n\n[1] 2\n[1] 3\n[1] 4\n\n\nWe […]\n\nfor( k in 1:6) {\n  if(k %% 2 == 0) {\n    print(paste(k, \"is even\"))\n  } else {\n    print(paste(k, \"is odd\"))\n  }\n}\n\n[1] \"1 is odd\"\n[1] \"2 is even\"\n[1] \"3 is odd\"\n[1] \"4 is even\"\n[1] \"5 is odd\"\n[1] \"6 is even\"\n\n\n\n\nwhile- and repeat-loops\nThe remaining two types of loops in R (while and repeat loops) aren’t used as frequently as for loops, but I feel it prudent to at least mention their existence.

    "section": "The Vectorization of R",
    "text": "The Vectorization of R\nIt is often stated that R is vectorized. Effectively, this means that the fundamental object in R is a vector, and most functions, when applied to vectors, are applied element-wise.\nFor instance:\n\nc(1, 2, 3) + c(1, 1, 1)\n\n[1] 2 3 4\n\n\nis equivalent to\n\nc(1, 2, 3) + 1\n\n[1] 2 3 4\n\n\nSince columns and rows of matrices are effectively stored as vectors, this makes adding a scalar to each element of a matrix fairly easy:\n\nM &lt;- matrix(1:6, nrow = 3, byrow = T)\nM\n\n     [,1] [,2]\n[1,]    1    2\n[2,]    3    4\n[3,]    5    6\n\nM + 2\n\n     [,1] [,2]\n[1,]    3    4\n[2,]    5    6\n[3,]    7    8\n\n\nMost functions are also vectorized; i.e. allow for vector-valued inputs. If you want to make a user-defined function vectorized, you can wrap your function in a call to the Vectorize() function. For example, consider the following implementation of the sign function:\n\nsgn_non_vectorized &lt;- function(x) {\n  if(x &lt; 0) {\n    return(\"negative\")\n  } else if(x == 0) {\n    return(\"zero\")\n  } else {\n    return(\"positive\")\n  }\n}\n\nCalling sgn_non_vectorized(-1) is fine:\n\nsgn_non_vectorized(-1)\n\n[1] \"negative\"\n\n\nhowever calling sgn_non_vectorized(c(-1, 1)) causes problems:\n\nsgn_non_vectorized(c(-1, 1))\n\nError in if (x &lt; 0) {: the condition has length &gt; 1\n\n\nWe can fix this using the Vectorize() function:\n\nsgn_vectorized &lt;- Vectorize(\n  function(x){sgn_non_vectorized(x)}\n)\nsgn_vectorized(c(-1, 1))\n\n[1] \"negative\" \"positive\"\n\n\nBy the way, note that the above example also demonstrates the following: unlike in Python, you do not need to explicitly include a return statement in the body of an R function. By default, R will return whatever the final non-assignment step of your code is.\n\nLeveraging Vectorization to Bypass Loops\nAn interesting consequence of the vectorized nature of R is that we can actually bypass loops in certain contexts. Functions that help us do this include (but are not limited to):\n\napply(): applies a function to either rows or columns (or both) of an array or matrix\nlapply() and sapply(): applies a function across a list (differences between the functions largely boil down to the data type/structure of output)\n\nAs an example, consider the following matrix M (which we encountered above)\n\nM\n\n     [,1] [,2]\n[1,]    1    2\n[2,]    3    4\n[3,]    5    6\n\n\nTo compute row averages (i.e. averages across rows), we could use a for loop:\n\nrow_avgs &lt;- c()\nfor(k in 1:nrow(M)) {\n  row_avgs &lt;- c(row_avgs, mean(M[k,]))\n}\nrow_avgs\n\n[1] 1.5 3.5 5.5\n\n\nAlternatively, we could use the apply() function:\n\napply(M, MARGIN = 1, FUN = mean)\n\n[1] 1.5 3.5 5.5"

Further suppose we’d like our function to return an error message stating \"Input must be of type 'double' or 'integer'\" if the input is not numerical (i.e. neither an integer nor a double). We can do so by using the stop() function:\n\nadd_2 &lt;- function(x) {\n  if(!(typeof(x) == \"double\") & !(typeof(x) == \"integer\")) {\n    stop(\"Input must be of type 'double' or 'integer'\")\n  } else {\n    return(x + 2)\n  }\n}\n\nadd_2(4.2)\n\n[1] 6.2\n\nadd_2(\"hello\")\n\nError in add_2(\"hello\"): Input must be of type 'double' or 'integer'"

Loosely speaking, in computer science, we us the term recursion to describe a situation in which the current computational step depends on one or more computational steps that were completed in the past.\nA simple mathematical example of recursion is the Fibonacci Numbers, which is a sequence \\(\\{a_n\\}\\) of numbers defined through the recursive relationship \\[ a_0 = 0, \\quad a_1 = 1, \\quad a_{n} = a_{n - 1} + a_{n - 2} \\ (\\forall n \\geq 2) \\] For instance, the first 7 Fibonacci numbers are \\(\\{0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8\\}\\).\nLet’s say we want to create a function fib() that takes in a single integer input n and outputs the nth Fibonacci number. Firstly, this is not as simple as the examples we’ve seen before because there isn’t a closed-form formula for the nth Fibonacci number1.\n\nHowever, we can think of defining this function recursively. The key is to note that, if we have configured our fib() function correctly, we have that\n\nfib(n) = fib(n) + fib(n - 1)\n\nWe also know that\n\nfib(0) = 0\nfib(1) = 1\n\nThis motivates us to define our fib() function as follows:\n\nfib &lt;- Vectorize(function(n) {\n  if(n == 0) {\n    return(0)\n  } else if (n == 1) {\n    return(1)\n  } else {\n    return( fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2))\n  }\n})\n\nAs an example:\n\nfib(1:7)\n\n[1]  1  1  2  3  5  8 13\n\n\nwhich matches what we computed “by hand”, above."

    "text": "Adding Columns\nTo add a column, simply use the $ syntax to pretend you were accessing the column (even though it doesn’t exist yet), and then use the variable assignment operator to pass in a set of values:\n\nmy_df$col3 &lt;- c(\"red\", \"green\", \"blue\")\nmy_df\n\n  col1      col2  col3\n1    2 greetings   red\n2    4     happy green\n3    6     world  blue\n\n\nWhat happens if we try and add a column that has more values than rows in our dataframe? Well, let’s see:\n\nmy_df$col4 &lt;- c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE)\n\nError in `$&lt;-.data.frame`(`*tmp*`, col4, value = c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, : replacement has 4 rows, data has 3\n\n\nSo, this is something important to note: when adding a column to a dataframe, you must ensure that the number of values you are adding is the same as the number of rows in the dataframe.\nSay we really wanted to add a fourth colunmn to our my_df dataframe, with the values c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE). We could simply add a fourth row of missing values (NA) to the already-existing dataframe, and then append the column:\n\nmy_df[4,] &lt;- c(NA, NA, NA)\nmy_df$col4 &lt;- c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE)\nmy_df\n\n  col1      col2  col3  col4\n1    2 greetings   red  TRUE\n2    4     happy green FALSE\n3    6     world  blue  TRUE\n4   NA      &lt;NA&gt;  &lt;NA&gt; FALSE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\n\nThere are pros and cons to doing this. On the one hand, we’ve successfully added all the values we wanted to into our new column. However, we have done so at the cost of injecting missingness into our data. Depending on what we plan to do with the dataframe this may or may not be a big deal- so, just think critically before doing something like this."

    "text": "Changing Column Names\nThe column names of our my_df dataframe are pretty uninformative. Let’s see if we can give the columns more interesting names!\nTo access the column names of a dataframe, we can use either names() or colnames():\n\ncolnames(my_df)\n\n[1] \"col1\" \"col2\" \"col3\" \"col4\"\n\n\nTo rename our columns, we can simply assign (using the variable assignment operator) a new list of names:\n\ncolnames(my_df) &lt;- c(\"numbers\", \"words\", \"colors\", \"booleans\")\nmy_df\n\n  numbers     words colors booleans\n1       2 greetings    red     TRUE\n2       4     happy  green    FALSE\n3       6     world   blue     TRUE\n4      NA      &lt;NA&gt;   &lt;NA&gt;    FALSE\n\n\nWe can, if we like, do something similar to assign names to the rows of our dataframe:\n\nrownames(my_df) &lt;- c(\"row1\", \"row2\", \"row3\", \"row4\")\nmy_df\n\n     numbers     words colors booleans\nrow1       2 greetings    red     TRUE\nrow2       4     happy  green    FALSE\nrow3       6     world   blue     TRUE\nrow4      NA      &lt;NA&gt;   &lt;NA&gt;    FALSE"
