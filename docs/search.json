Topics include an introduction to inference and prediction, principles of measurement, missing data, and notions of causality, statistical “traps”, and concepts in data ethics and privacy. Case studies will illustrate the importance of domain knowledge. Credit units: 4.\n\nIndeed, this course is designed to be a hands-on introduction to Data Science for intermediate-level students with some exposure to probability and basic computation skills, but with few or no upper-division courses in statistics."

    "text": "Assessments\n\nLabs: short, structured coding assignments designed to introduce programming concepts and skills. Labs will be assigned weekly, and are designed to be mostly completed during Section on Monday but won’t be due until 11:59pm on Wednesdays.\nHomeworks: slightly larger in scope than labs; will contain both programming and theoretical/conceptual concepts. We will have a total of 3 homework assignments released throughout the quarter; typically you will have 1-2 weeks to work on the homeworks and you are encouraged to start as early as possible!\nMini Projects: more open-ended than homeworks and labs, and are designed to more closely simulate real-world data science projects and endeavors. We will have a total of 3 mini projects (released in non-exam weeks where there are no homeworks due) throughout the quarter, and you are encouraged to work collaboratively.\nFinal Project: a final, comprehensive project that will be due during finals week. You will be required to work in teams on the Final Project.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinal Project\n\n\n\nThe final project will be due by 11:59pm on Tuesday, June 11.\n\n\n\n2 In-Class Assessments (ICAs) will be administered (see below for dates). I hesitate to call these “exams” because they are not intended to be as high-stakes as exams, however they are designed to test your retention of course material. More information will be released as we approach the date of the first ICA.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssessment Dates\n\n\n\n\nIn-Class Assessment 1: Thursday, April 25, 2024 in BUCHN 1940 (our Lecture classroom) starting at 9:30 (our regular class time)\nIn-Class Assessment 2: Thursday, May 23, 2024 in BUCHN 1940 (our Lecture classroom) starting at 9:30 (our regular class time)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nThere will be no ICAs offered at alternate times, for any reasons. So, please plan accordingly!\n\n\n\nFinal Course Grades\nYour final course grade will be computed according to the following weights:\n\n\n\nAssessment\nWeight\n\n\n\n\nLabs\n10%\n\n\nHW\n15%\n\n\nMini Projects\n20%\n\n\nFinal Project\n25%\n\n\nIn-Class Assessments\n30%\n\n\n\nYour final letter grade will be issued according to the following scheme (cutoffs between plusses and minuses will be calculated at the end of the quarter):\n\nA- – A+: 90 – 100%\nB– – B+: 80 – 89.99%\nC– – C+: 70 – 79.99%\nD– – D+ : 60 – 69.99%\nF: 0 – 59.99%\n\nI have elected to adopt an uncurved grading scheme to eliminate any sense of “competition” among students; I highly encourage you all to collaborate with and uplift each other. Having said that, I will certainly consider adjusting the cutoffs at the end of the quarter if necessary."

    "text": "Policies\n\nLate Submissions\nYou are allowed two late submissions across homeworks and labs (so, 2 in total; not 2 each), that must be submitted within 48 hours of the original deadline. No work will be accepted beyond 48 hours after the original deadline. Additionally, because projects may/will be collaborative, late project submissions will not be accepted.\n\n\nCommunication\nThere are two primary means of communication outside of scheduled class meetings: office hours and a Discord Server. If you are unsure of how to reach out to appropriate parties, please consult the following table:\n\n\n\nTopic\nRedirect to…\n\n\n\n\nTroubleshooting codes\nDiscord\n\n\nChecking answers\nOffice hours or Discord\n\n\nClarifying assignment content\nOffice hours or Discord\n\n\nAssignment submission\nGradescope\n\n\nRe-evaluation request\nGradescope\n\n\nQuestion about missing grades\nFill Out This Form\n\n\n\nSome additional comments:\n\nPlease note that we (the course staff) request you refrain from emailing us except in case of extreme emergency (it is up to you to decide what is an ‘emergency’). Please bring all of your questions to the course staff during either Office Hours or after Lecture/Section. (Also, please note that DMs [Direct Messages] sent to the course staff through Discord will be ignored. Additionally, non-emergency emails [e.g. about content, missing grades, etc.] will be ignored.) Thank you!\nIf you have questions or concerns about missing grades, please use the form linked in the table above. You are allowed to submit the form multiple times, but we ask that you please wait at least 48 business hours before submitting follow-ups. Thank you!\n\n\n\nCollaboration and Academic Integrity\nData Science (as we will see) is an inherently collaborative field. As such, you are not only allowed but also encouraged to collaborate on assignments (be they lab, homework, or project). However, there are limitations to collaboration:\n\ncollaboration on the ICAs is strictly prohibited\ndo not copy other people’s work and try to pass it off as your own\nif/when you work in groups, include the names of all group members on the assignment\n\nAnyone found guilty of academic misconduct will be reported to the Academic Senate, and will receive at minimum a failing grade on the assignment in question; further actions may also include failing the course, and marks being made on permanent records. Depending on the severity of the infraction, expulsion is also a possibility.\nBasically, don’t cheat- please! If you’re ever struggling with course material, please come talk to me or the TA’s. We are truly here for you, and want only the best for you.\n\n\nSection Switching\nLab Sections take place in special “Collaborate Classrooms” which are equipped with laptops. There are only a fixed number of seats and laptops in these classrooms, meaning we cannot under any circumstance over-enroll sections. Therefore, if you want to switch section unofficially (we do not have the ability to switch your official enrollment through GOLD), please follow the steps at this link. Any requests to switch sections that do not adhere to the guidelines posted at that link will be ignored."
