## {{< fa info >}} Course Logistics
### Course Policies

-   If you haven't already, please read through the <a href="https://ucsb-pstat100.github.io/Pages/Info/policies.html" target="_blank">Course Policies</a> fully.

    -   They lay out policies surrounding late work, how your final grades will be computed, what constitutes allowable use of AI, and much more.
    
-   One highlight: you will be graded on labs, homeworks, projects, and in-class assessments.

    -   The Course Policies provide further details on how these assignments differ, as well as how they factor in to your final course grade.
    

## {{< fa lightbulb >}} Some Tips for Success

-   Create a weekly schedule for yourself, and allocate a bit of time for PSTAT 100 each day.
    -   E.g. for working on homework/projects, working through practice problems, reviewing notes, etc.

-   Take notes!
    -   Course slides are somewhat comprehensive, _but not the full story_ - I'll often say things in class that are very important (and potentially testable on ICAs...)
    
-   Form Study Groups
    -   Data Science is a highly collaborative field - get some practice forming these connections by connecting with your fellow classmates!

::: {.column width=40%}
-   [**Interdisciplinary**]{.alert}; emphasis on [**domain knowledge**]{.alert}

    -   Draws from expertise and innovations from many fields

-   [**Data-Driven**]{.alert}; collects, interprets, and uses data to say things about the world.

### Stats, Maths, and Computing

-   Notice that these three fields (loosely) correspond to the three prerequisites for this course!

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="33.3333%"}
::: {.fragment}
**Stats** (PSTAT 120A)

-   Data has _error_ and _randomness_; we need probability to be able to draw conclusions in the face of this randomness
:::
:::

::: {.column width="33.3333%"}
::: {.fragment}
**Maths** (MATH 4A)

-   Data is naturally expressible as matrices and vectors (more on this next week)
:::
:::

::: {.column width="33.3333%"}
::: {.fragment}
**Computing** (CMPSC 9/16)

-   Data is large, and often too complicated to handle by hand (without the aid of computing software)

### Still Very New!

![](Images/data_science_merriam_webster.png)


## {{< fa arrows-spin >}} Data Science Lifecycle
### First Version

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width=40%}
![](Images/dsl_simple.svg)
:::

::: {.column width=60%}
-   The [**Data Science Lifecycle**]{.alert} (DSL) seeks to describe the general _lifecycle_ of a typical data science project.

-   Four main stages: [**questioning**]{.alert}, [**collecting**]{.alert}, [**analyzing**]{.alert}, and [**interpreting**]{.alert}.

-   Lots of variations of the DSL, some with more steps than others.

-   Main idea: data science projects are highly [**iterative**]{.alert}.
:::

::::


## {{< fa arrows-spin >}} Data Science Lifecycle
### Second Version

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width=40%}
![](Images/dsl_complex.svg)
:::

::: {.column width=60%}
-   In my opinion, this is a much better representation of the DSL! (Though the graphic is certainly too complex.)

-   Again, data science is a highly iterative field; we rarely proceed in a linear fashion from start to finish.

    -   Rather, we start, analyze out data, realize we need more data, collect more data, analyze our new data, realize we need to revise our original question, etc.
:::

::::

## {{< fa arrows-spin >}} Data Science Lifecycle
### Starting the Cycle

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width=40%}
![](Images/DSL_question.svg)
:::

::: {.column width=60%}
-   Sometimes we'll begin with a question we want to answer.

-   E.g. "Has air quality in the US improved over time?"

-   E.g. "How has the distribution of wealth and income changed since the economic recession of 2008?"

### Starting the Cycle

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width=40%}
![](Images/DSL_question_collect.svg)
:::

::: {.column width=60%}
-   In this case, our question will dictate what kind of data to collect
    -   E.g. AQI data
    -   E.g. Income Data; Federal Bank Data; etc.
    
-   In other cases, we'll _start_ with a dataset, which will then inform what question we want to ask.
    -   Limitations in our dataset may also necessitate changes in our question; we'll return to this point in a few lectures.
:::

### Traveling Through the Cycle

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width=40%}
![](Images/DSL_question_collect_analyze.svg)
:::

::: {.column width=60%}
-   Once we have our data, we need to analyze it.
-   This might involve [**data cleaning**]{.alert} or [**data tidying**]{.alert}; this could also involve producing appropriate [**visualizations**]{.alert}.
    -   At this stage, we may perform [**Exploratory Data Analysis**]{.alert} (EDA).
    -   In certain cases, we may find it useful to apply techniques from [**maching learning**]{.alert} to better understand our dataset.

### Traveling Through the Cycle

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width=40%}
![](Images/dsl_simple.svg)
:::

::: {.column width=60%}
-   Finally, we need to understand what our data is saying.
-   This will typically involve answering our question(s); oftentimes we'll take things a step further and see if we can use our data to make sense of the world.
-   A key component of this stage of the DSL is producing some sort of a [**report**]{.alert} or [**presentation**]{.alert}.
:::

::::

## {{< fa location-pin >}} PSTAT 100

-   We'll be returning to the different stages of the DSL throughout this course (though not necessarily in order).
    -   Consequently, I don't expect you to understand all of the jargon on the previous few slides!
    
-   Today, we'll start by addressing a question that is not explicitly part of the DSL, but implicitly forms the backbone of it: **_What is Data?_**

-   According to Merriam-Webster ([source](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/data)), there are three definitions for **data**:

1)  factual information (such as measurements or statistics) used as a basis for reasoning, discussion, or calculation

2)  information in digital form that can be transmitted or processed

3)  information output by a sensing device or organ that includes both useful and irrelevant or redundant information and must be processed to be meaningful

-   I like the first definition, particularly the phrase "used as a basis for reasoning, discussion, or calculation."

-   Raw data is often uninterpretable (and, in some cases, useless)

-   It’s the job of a Data Scientist to interpret the data, and use it to assess beliefs.

## **Definition**

[**Data Literacy:**]{.alert} "the ability to explore, understand, and communicate with data in a meaningful way." (_Tableau_; [ source](https://www.tableau.com/data-insights/data-literacy/what-is#definition))
:::
:::

-   One of the goals of PSTAT 100 is to increase your _data literacy_.

-   We'll develop a series of tools (that you will expound upon in your future PSTAT courses) in service of this goal.


## {{< fa cat >}} A Dataset
### Cats!

-   Let's take a look at a concrete dataset.

-   This particular dataset was collected in 2013 by a collection veterinarians at The Royal Veterinary College in the United Kingdom.

    -   The primary goal of the study was to investigate the prevalence of epilepsy in cats; for today, we’ll only be considering the characteristics of the cats included in the study.

-   Spend a few seconds taking in the dataset, and I'd like to know your initial reactions.


## {{< fa cat >}} A Dataset
### Cats!

```{r, out.lines = 1000}
#| class-output: hscroll
#| echo: False
#| eval: True

options(max.print = 5000)
cats <- read.csv("Data/cats_data_2019.csv") %>% 
  select(c(!RSD)) %>% select(c(!Epilepsy)) %>% select(c(!Insured))
print(as.data.frame(cats), row.names = FALSE)
```

## {{< fa cat >}} Cats Dataset
### Initial Thoughts


-   On the one hand, we could make some observations about _how the data is displayed_
    -   For example, it's a _pretty big_ dataset (I even had to truncate the output so that it fits in this presentation!)
    -   The entries are displayed _tabularly_ (sometimes called "rectangularly")

-   On the other, we could make observations about _what the data is saying_
    -   Each row represents information about a particular cat
    -   From each cat, we have information on a series of attributes (sex, age, etc.)


## {{< fa code-fork >}} Semantics vs. Structure

-   In general, we distinguish between the [**semantics**]{.alert} and [**structure**]{.alert} of a particular dataset.

-   The semantics of a dataset relate to the _meaning_ behind the data.
    -   What is the data trying to tell us?

-   The structure of a dataset pertains to how the data is _displayed_ or _organized_.
    -   How is the data telling us what it is telling us?

-   We'll focus on data semantics for today, and return to the topic of data structure tomorrow.

## {{< fa spell-check >}} Data Semantics
### Definition

:::{.callout-note}
## **Definition:** Data

We define an [**observation**]{.alert} to be a collection of [**values**]{.alert} measured on certain [**attributes**]{.alert} (aka [**variables**]{.alert}). From a semantic standpoint, we define **data** to be a collection of observations collected on [**observational units**]{.alert}.
:::

## {{< fa cat >}} Cats Dataset
### Semantics

```{r}
#| class-output: hscroll
#| echo: False
#| eval: True

options(max.print = 20)
print(as.data.frame(cats), row.names = FALSE)
```

Example Observation:

> There was a 14.75154-year old Neutered Male Domestic Short Hair Cat, whose ID was 1.
:::


## {{< fa cat >}} Cats Dataset
### Semantics

> There was a cat whose **ID** was 1, whose **breed** was "Domestic Short hair", whose **age** was 14.75154, whose **sex** was "Male", and whose **Neutered status** was "Neutered".

-   **Variables:** `ID`, `Breed`, `Age`, `Sex`, `Neutered Status`

::: {.fragment}
> There was a cat whose ID was **1**, whose breed was **"Domestic Short hair"**, whose age was **14.75154**, whose sex was **"Male"**, and whose Neutered status was **"Neutered"**.
:::

-   **Values:** (1, "Domestic Short hair", 14.75154, "Male", "Neutered")

## {{< fa spell-check >}} Data Semantics
### Observational Units

-   When trying to identify the observational units of a particular dataset, I like to ask myself the question: "if I were to replicate this data (i.e. re-collect it myself), what object/item would I actually observe/take measurements on?"
    -   For example, if I wanted to replicate the cats dataset, I would need to start by collecting a bunch of cats, on which I could take measurements of whatever attributes I want.

-   Note that observational units aren't always living entities; we could imagine a dataset in which _countries_ are the observational units (e.g. we could measure various attributes - like GDP, life expectancy, etc. - about the different countries of the world)

## {{< fa landmark >}} Another Dataset
### Undergraduate PSTAT Course Enrollments

-   **Observational Units:** UCSB Courses

-   **An observation:** The enrollment for PSTAT 5A, titled "Understanding Data" was 167 in Spring 2025, 222 in Winter 2025, 213 in Fall 2024, etc.

-   **Variables:** `Spring 2025`, `Winter 2025`, `Fall 2024`, etc,

-   Is that right, though?
    -   What is the value of `Spring 2025` - is it really 167? 
    -   Isn't 167 the value of a `Course Enrollment` variable?
    -   Isn't `Spring 2025` actually itself a _value_ of another variable (one we might call `Quarter`)?
    

## {{< fa landmark >}} Another Dataset
### Undergraduate PSTAT Course Enrollments

-   At this point, we find ourselves at a bit of a crossroads. 

-   For now, let's adopt the following set of variables (tomorrow, we'll discuss whether or not this choice is unique - spoiler alert, it is not!)
    -   `Course`: the course ID
    -   `Course Title`: the course title
    -   `Quarter`: the quarter in which the course was offered
    -   `Enrollment`: the enrollment count of the particular course in a particular quarter

## {{< fa question >}} A Question

-   Could we have instead used `Spring 2025 Enrollment`, `Winter 2025 Enrollment`, etc. as our variables?

-   Well, we _could_... again, more on that during tomorrow's lecture. (Spoiler: it's not really a good idea.)

## **Moral of the Story**

It is not always the case that the variables in a dataset are the same as the column names.
:::

-   This starts to get into the _structure_ of a dataset, so we'll save a further discussion on this point for tomorrow's lecture.
    -   For now, I simply encourage you to think critically when trying to identify the variables in a particular dataset.

-   The good news is that, in many cases, the work is done for us: many datasets will come equipped with a [**data dictionary**]{.alert}, which is a specification of all the variables in the dataset and a brief description of what they represent.

### First Level

-   Notice how in both of the datasets we explored today, there were a few different types of variables.

-   For example, some variables have values that are numbers (e.g. the age of a cat; the enrollment total of a course; etc.) whereas others have values that are words (e.g. the species of a cat; the title of a course; etc.)

-   Indeed, at the highest level, variables are classified as either [**numerical**]{.alert} or [**categorical**]{.alert}.

    -   Numerical variables are those whose values are numbers; categorical variables are those whose values are categories.

::: {.callout-caution}
## **Caution**
It is a mistake to conclude that a variable is numerical solely because its _recorded_ values are numbers.
:::

-   For example, months can be encoded as either `January`, `February`, etc. or as `1`, `2`, `3`.
    -   Just because we're using `1` to mean `January` doesn't mean that a `month` variable is numerical - its possible values are still only categories, and hence it is a categorical variable.
    -   1 + 2 is 3, but `January` plus `February` is not `March`.

-   The better check is whether sums/differences of values have interpretive meaning- if so, the variable is numerical. Otherwise, the variable is categorical.

### Second Level

-   Not all numerical variables are alike.

-   For example, consider the following two: "number of accidents recorded along a highway", and "height of an individual."

-   Both variables are numerical (sums/differences have interpretive meaning).

-   However, most of us have an intuitive feeling that the set of all possible values associated with "number of accidents recorded along a highway" is more restrictive than the set of possible values associated with "height of an individual."

## **Definition**

A numerical variable whose set of possible values is finite or countable is said to be [**discrete**]{.alert}; a numerical variable whose set of possible values is uncountable is said to be [**continuous**]{.alert}.
:::


-   Note how this mirrors the definition of discrete and continuous _random_ variables that you (hopefully) saw in PSTAT 120A!

-   Even within categorical variables, there's a second level of classification. Consider: "letter grade" and "favorite color."

-   A grade of `A+` is _better_ than a grade of `A`, which is _better_ than a grade of `A-`, etc. whereas `green` is not inherently better than `red`, which is not inherently better than `purple`, etc.

## {{< fa forward-fast >}} Next Time

-   We'll continue our discussion on data.
    -   Specifically, we'll take a closer look at the _structure_ (as opposed to _semantics_) of a dataset
    -   We'll then discuss a framework to unify the semantics and structure of a dataset.
    
-   **Reminder:** please start Homework 1 early!
    -   Problem 1 is a Linear Algebra review, and Problem 2 combines Linear Algebra and PSTAT 120A (so you should be able to complete both problems already).
    -   For problem 3, you'll need to wait until Thursday's lecture.

-   If you are able, please bring your laptops to tomorrow's lecture.
