## Data Science Lifecycle
### First Version

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width=40%}
![](Images/dsl_simple.svg)
:::

::: {.column width=60%}
-   The [**Data Science Lifecycle**]{.alert} (DSL) seeks to describe the general _lifecycle_ of a typical data science project.

-   Four main stages: [**questioning**]{.alert}, [**collecting**]{.alert}, [**analyzing**]{.alert}, and [**interpreting**]{.alert}.

-   Lots of variations of the DSL, some with more steps than others.

-   Main idea: data science projects are highly [**iterative**]{.alert}.
:::

## Data Science Lifecycle
### Second Version

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width=40%}
![](Images/dsl_complex.svg)
:::

::: {.column width=60%}
-   In my opinion, this is a much better representation of the DSL! (Though the graphic is certainly too complex.)

-   Again, data science is a highly iterative field; we rarely proceed in a linear fashion from start to finish.

    -   Rather, we start, analyze out data, realize we need more data, collect more data, analyze our new data, realize we need to revise our original question, etc.

## Data Science Lifecycle
### Starting the Cycle

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width=40%}
![](Images/DSL_question.svg)
:::

::: {.column width=60%}
-   Sometimes we'll begin with a question we want to answer.

-   E.g. "Has air quality in the US improved over time?"

-   E.g. "How has the distribution of wealth and income changed since the economic recession of 2008?"

### Starting the Cycle

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width=40%}
![](Images/DSL_question_collect.svg)
:::

::: {.column width=60%}
-   In this case, our question will dictate what kind of data to collect
    -   E.g. AQI data
    -   E.g. Income Data; Federal Bank Data; etc.
    
-   In other cases, we'll _start_ with a dataset, which will then inform what question we want to ask.
    -   Limitations in our dataset may also necessitate changes in our question; we'll return to this point in a few lectures.

### Traveling Through the Cycle

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width=40%}
![](Images/DSL_question_collect_analyze.svg)
:::

::: {.column width=60%}
-   Once we have our data, we need to analyze it.
-   This might involve [**data cleaning**]{.alert} or [**data tidying**]{.alert}; this could also involve producing appropriate [**visualizations**]{.alert}.
    -   At this stage, we may perform [**Exploratory Data Analysis**]{.alert} (EDA).
    -   In certain cases, we may find it useful to apply techniques from [**maching learning**]{.alert} to better understand our dataset.

### Traveling Through the Cycle

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width=40%}
![](Images/dsl_simple.svg)
:::

::: {.column width=60%}
-   Finally, we need to understand what our data is saying.
-   This will typically involve answering our question(s); oftentimes we'll take things a step further and see if we can use our data to make sense of the world.
-   A key component of this stage of the DSL is producing some sort of a [**report**]{.alert} or [**presentation**]{.alert}.

## {{< fa lightbulb >}} Formulating a Research Question
### Some Tips

-   Formulating a good research question is a balancing act.
    -   On the one hand, your question should be specific enough to be answerable.
    -   On the other, yes/no questions tend to make relatively uninteresting research questions
        -   Sometimes, a collection of yes/no questions can be combined to create a more interesting research question.
    
-   Finally, make sure you are setting reasonable expectations with your question.
    -   After all, we only have a finite number of hours in a day, and a finite number of days before the showcase!
    

## {{< fa lightbulb >}} Formulating a Research Question
### First Example

::: {.callout-tip}
## **Question**: First Pass

Have global temperatures increased in the past decade?
:::

-   Let's start with positives.
    -   It's definitely applicable!
    -   It includes a specific time frame for investigation ("past decade")
    
-   However, it is a bit too specific.
    -   All we need to do is plot temperature over time, and we will certainly see the answer to be "yes".
    -   We can be a bit more ambitious than this!
    
    
    
## {{< fa lightbulb >}} Formulating a Research Question
### First Example

::: {.callout-tip}
## **Question**: Second Pass

[**How**]{.alert} have global temperatures increased in the past decade?
:::

-   This is a much "better" question.
    -   Somewhat open-ended; leaves something to actually be _done_!
    -   We can answer using a graph, using statistical hypothesis testing, or a wide array of other tools.
    


## {{< fa lightbulb >}} Formulating a Research Question
### Second Example

::: {.callout-tip}
## **Question**: First Pass

What have been the effects of Global Warming in the past decade?
:::

-   This is definitely not too specific; in fact, it might be a bit _too_ nonspecific...

-   Now, this might be a perfectly good question to start with. 
    -   But, as you conduct your analyses, I'd encourage you to start fine-tuning the question a bit more.
    -   Are you going to focus on temperature? Carbon emissions? The impact on wildlife? The impact on people?
    -   Trying to answer _all_ of these, as interesting as it may be, will not be feasible in the next few weeks.
    

## {{< fa lightbulb >}} Formulating a Research Question
### Third Example

::: {.callout-tip}
## **Question**: First Pass

Do UCLA students tend to, on average, have longer commute times than UCSB students?
:::

-   Let's discuss this one together - what are your thoughts?



## {{< fa table >}} Collecting Data

-   The next stage in the DSL is to [**collect data**]{.alert}.

-   Google is a great place to start!

-   Another popular site is <a href="http://kaggle.com/" target="_blank">Kaggle</a>.

-   If you're struggling with creating a research question, you can always start by finding an interesting _dataset_, and then formulating a question from that!

-   Let's run through an example of that.
