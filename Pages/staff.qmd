Hello! My name is **Ethan P. Marzban** (he/him), and I'm currently a PhD student in the Department of Statistics here at UCSB. My research interests span a variety of topics, including Bayesian techniques, mathematical statistics, and statistics and data science education. In my free time, I enjoy playing the piano, drinking boba, and talking about cats. I'm super excited to be your instructor this quarter!
