    -   This is the cover page that will be attached to the ICA on Thursday - I encourage you to read through it now, so you don't have to spend time reading through it during the actual ICA! <br /> <br />

    -   **Note:** Solutions will not be posted until **Tuesday July 1, 2025**. This is so that you spend more time working through the problems yourself; don't rely on the solutions to do the studying for you! <br /> <br />

    -   This is the ICA01 I administered in Spring 2024, when I last taught this course.
    -   **Important:** Certain problems are out-of-scope, because the order of topics has been changed slightly since Spring 2024. Additionally, the Spring 2024 ICA01 was entirely multiple choice whereas the Summer 2025 ICA will consist of a mix of multiple choice _and_ free response questions (please see the **Information Document** linked above). <br /> <br />
