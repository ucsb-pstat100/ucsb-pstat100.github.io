    -   This is the ICA01 I administered in Spring 2024, when I last taught this course.
    -   **Important:** Certain problems are out-of-scope, because the order of topics has been changed slightly since Spring 2024. Additionally, the Spring 2024 ICA01 was entirely multiple choice whereas the Summer 2025 ICA will consist of a mix of multiple choice _and_ free response questions (please see the **Information Document** linked above). <br /> <br />
