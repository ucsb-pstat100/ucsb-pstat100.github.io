## **Important** 

Below are solutions to selected assignment. Some things to keep in mind:

-   There may be typos, so please proceed with caution (feel free to ask during Office Hours!)
-   There are often many different ways to approach a problem, each of them “correct”! As such, if you work through a problem in a different way than the solutions that’s fine - your way is not necessarily wrong.

-   **Lab04 Note:** There was a typo in Question 9: you were meant to overlay the density over your histogram from Question _8_, not Question _7_. (The grader graded very leniently, as a result.)
