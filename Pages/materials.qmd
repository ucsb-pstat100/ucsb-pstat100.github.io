**Lab:**

There is **no** required lab for this week, as we will not be having any Sections on Monday. However, please keep in mind the following:

-   If you have never programmed in `R` before, please read <a href="https://intro2r.com/basics_r.html" target="_blank">Chapter 2: Some `R` basics</a> and <a href="https://intro2r.com/data_r.html" target="_blank">Chapter 3: Data in `R`</a>, from "An Introduction to R", and Chapters 2 and 27 from R4DS.

    -   <a href="../Labs/Lab00/intro2r.qmd" target="_blank">This Lab</a> provides a summary of important information about the basics of programming in `R`.

-   If you have some exposure to programming in `R` (or have already read Chapters 2 and 3 from I2R), but would like more practice with dataframes, we encourage you to complete the following lab: <a href="../Labs/Lab00/df_basics.qmd" target="_blank">[Click Here]</a>

Please note that, by virtue of being prerequisite, these concepts and topics are potentially testable on In-Class Assignments (and are also crucial for success in our future PSTAT 100 endeavors!).
