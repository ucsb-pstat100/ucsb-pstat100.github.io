(\"How has air quality changed over time?\" \"What factors affect feline contraction of FIV?\" etc.)\n\n:::\n\n::::\n\n\n-   Or, are you starting with a specific dataset you want to explore, from which you will (ultimately) formulate a question of interest?\n\n\n## Data Science Lifecycle\n\n::::{.columns}\n\n:::{.column width=\"40%\"}\n![](cycle.svg)\n:::\n\n:::{.column width=\"60%\"}\n\n:::{.nonincremental}\n-   The exact steps are not that important (and also not fully agreed-upon).\n:::\n\n-   The main idea is of an _iterative process_.\n\n:::\n\n::::\n\n\n-   Maybe your data will change the question you ask. Maybe, after a first pass, you will realize you need _additional_ data.\n\n",
